    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p><b>Who are you?</b> I'm a Clipper user and a software consultant. I need to download my Clipper transactions so I can expense them. Manually parsing a PDF is a pain, so I made this.</p>

    <p>
      <b>Is this safe?</b> In general it's not a great idea to upload personal
      data to random servers on the Internet. In this case, in the worst case, I
      could read all of the data in the PDF you upload.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>This server does not store or log your private information.</i> We read the PDF you upload to generate a CSV, and send the CSV back to you. The data you upload isn't accessible by anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't trust this server, you can <a href="https://github.com/kevinburke/clipper-api">download the source code</a> and run the application yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Why can I only get the last 60 days of data?</b> That's all that
      Clipper makes available. You can get one year worth of data if you write
      nicely to Clipper customer support.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Is there any other way to access my transaction data?</b> No, PDF is
      the only way Clipper makes it available.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>This is cool. Can I hire you?</b> Yes! See my website: <a href="https://burke.services">https://burke.services</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Where can I report errors or ask for features?</b> See the Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/kevinburke/clipper-api">github.com/kevinburke/clipper-api</a>.
